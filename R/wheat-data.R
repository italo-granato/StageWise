#' Genomic prediction from secondary traits in wheat
#' 
#' Canopy temperature (CT) measurements collected during grain fill; used for genomic prediction of grain yield (GY) in wheat. Data come from the drought and extreme drought environments of Rutkoski et al. (2016). The CT phenotype was dated 3/7/2014. Stage 1 BLUEs were computed using rep(trial) as a random effect.
